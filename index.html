    <I style="color:white; ">Heavenly bodies are objects in space that are naturally occurring and are not made by humans. They include stars, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. 
        These objects are fascinating to study and have been the subject of scientific research for centuries.</I>

    <h2 style="color:white;">STARS</h2>
    <div id="box1"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/38/111338-050-D23BE7C8/Stars-NGC-290-Hubble-Space-Telescope.jpg?w=400&h=300&c=crop" alt="Stars" height="100"/></div><br>
    <i style="color:white;">Stars are massive, luminous spheres of plasma that emit light and heat. They are the most common objects in the universe and are responsible for the creation of heavy elements through nuclear fusion.</i>

    <div id="box1"><img src="https://d2wkagtnczagqh.cloudfront.net/astrology-blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05153144/astrology-astronomy-earth-moon-space-saturn-planet-solar-system-creation_872147-3051_11zon.jpg" alt="Planets" height="100"/></div><br>
    <i style="color:white;">Planets are large, spherical objects that orbit around a star. They are classified into two categories: terrestrial planets and gas giants. Terrestrial planets are small, rocky planets that are similar in composition to Earth. Gas giants are large planets that are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.</i>

    <h2 style="color:white;">MOONS</h2>
    <div id="box1"><img src="https://orbitaltoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/How-many-Moons-In-Our-Solar-System-img.jpg" alt="Planets" height="100" /></div><br>
    <i style="color:white; ">Moons are natural satellites that orbit around a planet. They are typically much smaller than the planet they orbit and are often composed of rock and ice.</i>
  
    <hr>
    <h2 style="color:white;">ASTROIDS</h2>
    <div id="box1"><img src="https://www.astronomy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/asteroidfacts.jpg?fit=600%2C394" alt="Planets" height="100"/></div><br>
    <i style="color:white;">Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit around the sun. They are typically found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.</i>
  
    <hr>
    <h2 style="color:white;">COMETS</h2>
    <div id="box1"><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/10/04/17/newFile-6.jpg" alt="Planets" height="100"/></div><br>
    <I style="color:white; ">Comets are icy objects that orbit around the sun. They are composed of dust, ice, and frozen gases and have a distinctive tail that points away from the sun.</I>

    <h2 style="color:white;">METEOROIDS</h2>
    <div id="box1"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/48/191948-131-BDB35461/Meteor-shower-Elements-image-NASA.jpg" alt="Planets" height="100"/></div><br>
    <I style="color:white; ">Meteoroids are small rocks or particles that are in space. When they enter the Earth's atmosphere, they are called meteors. If they survive the journey through the atmosphere and hit the ground, they are called meteorites.</I>
